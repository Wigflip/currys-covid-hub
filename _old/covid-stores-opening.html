										<h3>Refunds and returns for store purchases:</h3>
										<p>While our stores are temporarily closed, we&rsquo;re giving customers extra time to return products. You will still have 21 days from the date you purchased, but this will exclude the dates that your local store is closed or offering collections only. All other terms and conditions are unchanged &ndash; so if you&rsquo;ve changed your mind and no longer want a product, this can be returned as long as it&rsquo;s still in the original unopened packaging and unused.</p>
									</div>
									<div>
										<h3>Laptop collection:</h3>
										<p>To keep you safe some laptops will come set up and ready to use. That way you won&rsquo;t have to set foot inside our store. Of course, we&rsquo;ll have to open the packaging to do this. We&rsquo;ll call you once you&rsquo;ve arrived to let you know if your laptop has already been set up. Don&rsquo;t worry - your returns policy won&rsquo;t be affected.</p>

							<div class="inner">
								<p>For our extended warranty customers (Care &amp; Repair, Repair &amp; Support Plan or Care Plan), our repair lead times may be longer than usual. We&rsquo;re prioritising key workers and vulnerable customers where possible. If your tech is still working and only needs a minor repair, you may have a longer wait time whilst we focus our team on big fixes &ndash; we&rsquo;ll be able to advise when you get in touch.</p>
								<p>We&rsquo;re not able to support the following customers until further notice: all dishwasher repairs, any Instant Replacement agreements or those who need a chargeable repair service.</p>

								<h3>Extended warranty customers:</h3>
								<p>Please contact us on 0344 561 1234 to book your product for a repair. For items that need to be taken to our specialist repair centre (like TVs or laptops), we&rsquo;ll arrange to collect your product from your home.</p>
								<p>If you&rsquo;re a critical worker, or an extremely vulnerable/shielding customer (

								<p>Where home visits are required for household appliance repairs, we&rsquo;re also taking extra precautions to keep customers and our repair engineers safe:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Our repair crews will take all necessary safety precautions, including using antibacterial gel before and after every visit and will use cleaning wipes where possible. </li>
									<li>We&rsquo;ll call you before your appointment. If anyone at the property is isolating due to potential exposure, we won&rsquo;t be able to complete the appointment and will re-schedule. </li>
									<li>We ask that you stay 2m away from our repair engineers at all times and ideally in another room while they work on your appliance. Don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;ll still show you that everything is up and running (or advise on next steps) before leaving. </li>
									<li>Our repair engineers are also following latest government advice and self-isolating where they need to. This means that your repair appointment may be changed at the last minute. Please bear with us if this happens, we&rsquo;ll get to you as quickly as we can. </li>

								<h3>Instant Replacement plans:</h3>
								<p>If you have an Instant Replacement agreement (products under &pound;150), we&rsquo;re really sorry, but we&rsquo;re not able to support you until our shops re-open and our repair operation returns to normal.</p>

								<h3>Chargeable repairs:</h3>
								<p>For customers without an extended warranty agreement, we&rsquo;re temporarily suspending our repair services until further notice.</p>
