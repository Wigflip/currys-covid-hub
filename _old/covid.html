                                <p>We want our colleagues to be able to visit your home safely so, with that in mind, we’re stopping all installation services except our specialist electric and gas installs for cookers, ovens and hobs.</p>
                                <p>We think this is vital to keep the basics of family life going so we&rsquo;ll keep doing it, but we&rsquo;re taking major safety precautions;</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Please keep at least 2m away from our install crews at all times</li>
                                    <li>If you can, stay in another room away from where our install crews are working &ndash; they&rsquo;ll still get you to check everything is working OK before they leave</li>
                                    <li>Our install crews are also following the latest government advice on self-isolation &ndash; this means that some install services may be changed last minute &ndash; please bear with us, we will get to you as quick as we can</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>All installations are completed at the discretion of our install teams. If we&rsquo;re unable to complete your install for any reason, we&rsquo;ll discuss alternative arrangements with you.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>If you’ve already placed an order for a different install service, we’re really sorry, but we’ll be in touch to cancel.</strong> We want to make sure we’re limiting contact where possible to protect our colleagues and you. We’ll automatically refund this part of your order. Please bear with us whilst we do this. Your delivery will go ahead as planned.</p>
                                <p><strong>We’re currently unable to offer new bookings on our cooking installation services in South Wales and the North East of the England due to the availability of specialist colleagues.</strong> To check whether our install service is available at your address, please check the services section in our checkout.

                                <p>If you’ve added recycling to your order, we’ll go ahead with collecting your old appliance. Please make sure it is safely disconnected before our teams arrive.</p>
                                <p>Please note, gas and hardwired electrical products will need to be disconnected by a qualified professional. </p>
                                <p>Please help our teams by having it outside your property ready for collection if it’s safe for you to do so.</p>

                                    <li>Our repair engineers are also following latest government advice and self-isolating where they need to.

                                                <li>We will call you before your appointment. If anyone at the property is isolating due to potential exposure, we will not complete the appointment and will re-schedule.</li>
                                                <li>We ask that you stay 2m away from our repair engineers at all times and ideally in another room whilst they work on your appliance – don’t worry, they’ll still show you that everything is  up and running (or advise on next steps) before leaving.</li>
                                                <li>Our repair engineers are also following latest government advice and self-isolating where they need to. This means that your repair appointment may be changed at the last minute. Please bear with us if this happens, we’ll get to you as quickly as we can.</li>
