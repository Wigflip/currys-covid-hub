									<h3>How we&rsquo;re keeping you safe:</h3>
									<p>We&rsquo;ve added lots of new safety measures at our stores. They&rsquo;re all  clearly signposted. We&rsquo;re also asking all of our colleagues to wear face coverings where possible.</p>
									<p>Most importantly, we ask that you please don&rsquo;t visit our stores if you or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID-19. This includes using our drive-thru collection service.</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Here&rsquo;s how you can help keep everyone safe...</strong>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>In England and Scotland, it is now mandatory to wear a face covering when shopping with us.</li>
										<li>Please follow the signs and keep 2m from other customers and colleagues.</li>
										<li>As we&rsquo;re limiting the number of customers inside our stores at any one time, there might be a short wait. Thanks for bearing with us.</li>
										<li>Please follow the one-way arrows around the store.</li>
										<li>Please avoid touching products where you can.</li>
										<li>Please use the anti-bacterial gel available throughout the store.</li>
										<li>Please use a card or contactless for payment where possible.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>To keep you safe we&rsquo;ve added safety screens at our till points and customer service desk. And we&rsquo;re upping our cleaning efforts &ndash; sanitising trollies, baskets, demo products and more to keep you safe.</p>

											<p>We are taking extra precautions to keep you and our repair engineers safe:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Our repair crews will take all necessary safety precautions, including using antibacterial gel before and after every visit and will use cleaning wipes where possible.</li>
												<li>We will call you before your appointment. If anyone at the property is isolating due to potential exposure, we will not complete the appointment and will re-schedule.</li>
												<li>We ask that you stay 2m away from our repair engineers at all times and ideally in another room whilst they work on your appliance &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;ll still show you that everything is  up and running (or advise on next steps) before leaving.</li>
												<li>Our repair engineers are also following latest government advice and self-isolating where they need to. This means that your repair appointment may be changed at the last minute. Please bear with us if this happens, we&rsquo;ll get to you as quickly as we can.</li>
