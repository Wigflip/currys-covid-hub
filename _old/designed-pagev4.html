            <p>We think this is vital to keep the basics of family life going so we&rsquo;ll keep doing it, but we&rsquo;re taking major safety precautions;</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Please keep at least 2m away from our install crews at all times</li>
               <li>If you can, stay in another room away from where our install crews are working &ndash; they&rsquo;ll still get you to check everything is working OK before they leave</li>
               <li>Our install crews are also following the latest government advice on self-isolation &ndash; this means that some install services may be changed last minute &ndash; please bear with us, we will get to you as quick as we can</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All installations are completed at the discretion of our install teams. If we&rsquo;re unable to complete your install for any reason, we&rsquo;ll discuss alternative arrangements with you.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>If you’ve already placed an order for a different install service, we’re really sorry, but we’ll be in touch to cancel.</strong> We want to make sure we’re limiting contact where possible to protect our colleagues and you. We’ll automatically refund this part of your order. Please bear with us whilst we do this. Your delivery will go ahead as planned.</p>
            <p><strong>We’re currently unable to offer new bookings on our cooking installation services in South Wales and the North East of the England due to the availability of specialist colleagues.</strong> To check whether our install service is available at your address, please check the services section in our checkout.

            <h3>Recycling services</h3>
            <p>If you’ve added recycling to your order, we’ll go ahead with collecting your old appliance. Please make sure it is safely disconnected before our teams arrive.</p>
            <p>Please help our teams by having it outside your property ready for collection if it’s safe for you to do so.</p>

                <li>Royal Mail is an unsigned service. Where Royal Mail needs to deliver a parcel, its teams will place the parcel at your door.

We’re prioritising key workers and vulnerable customers where possible. If your tech is still working and only needs a minor repair, you may have a longer wait time whilst we focus our team on big fixes – we’ll be able to advise when you get in touch. </p>

            <p>Please contact us on 0344 561 1234 to book your product for a repair. For items that need to be taken to our specialist repair centre (like TVs or laptops), we’ll arrange to collect your product from your home. </p>

            <p>If you’re a critical worker, or an extremely vulnerable/shielding customer (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" target="_blank">as defined by the UK government</a>), please mention this when you contact us.

            <p>Where home visits are required for household appliance repairs, we’re also taking extra precautions to keep customers and our repair engineers safe:  </strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>Our repair crews will take all necessary safety precautions, including using antibacterial gel before and after every visit and will use cleaning wipes where possible. </li>
               <li>We’ll call you before your appointment. If anyone at the property is isolating due to potential exposure, we won’t be able to complete the appointment and will re-schedule. </li>
               <li>We ask that you stay 2m away from our repair engineers at all times and ideally in another room while they work on your appliance. Don’t worry, they’ll still show you that everything is up and running (or advise on next steps) before leaving. </li>
               <li>Our repair engineers are also following latest government advice and self-isolating where they need to. This means that your repair appointment may be changed at the last minute. Please bear with us if this happens, we’ll get to you as quickly as we can. </li>

            <h3>Instant Replacement plans: </h3>
            <p>If you have an Instant Replacement agreement (products under £150), we’re really sorry, but we’re not able to support you until our shops re-open and our repair operation returns to normal. </p>
            <p>We know this will be disappointing for many customers, but we’re trying to focus our teams on those customers who need our help the most. </p>


            <h3>Chargeable repairs: </h3>
            <p>For customers without an extended warranty agreement, we’re temporarily suspending our repair services until further notice.  </p>
