					<strong>We&rsquo;re re-introducing our delivery service to a room of your choice for big items (TVs over 40&rdquo; and kitchen appliances), if you&rsquo;d prefer a delivery to your front door only, we can do that too. We&rsquo;ll give you a call on the day of your delivery, just let us know what you&rsquo;d prefer.</strong>
					<p>Please maintain the recommended social-distancing gap of 2m from our delivery teams at all times and where possible have doors open so we don&rsquo;t need to touch door handles.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="currys-bg-color">
					<p>We&rsquo;re also taking extra steps to make sure our teams are delivering safely:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We&rsquo;re asking our teams to wear face coverings where possible</li>
						<li>We&rsquo;re using anti-bac gel and cleaning wipes before and after every delivery </li>
						<li>We&rsquo;re wearing appropriate protection equipment </li>
						<li>We&rsquo;re maintaining 2m social distancing at all our distribution sites</li>
						<li>We&rsquo;re completing temperature checks before shifts </li>
						<li>We&rsquo;re keeping the same delivery partners working together where possible</li>
						<li>We&rsquo;re following the latest government advice to self-isolate if we&rsquo;re experiencing any Coronavirus symptoms or need to quarantine as per government advice (this may mean that some deliveries are changed last minute, we&rsquo;re working hard to minimise this)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Delivery service for small items</h2>
					<p>Our courier partners (DPD and Royal Mail) have all updated their delivery processes to take extra precautions due to Coronavirus.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="currys-bg-color">
					<ol>
						<li>Please use the DPD app to nominate a &lsquo;safe place&rsquo; for your delivery to be left. If you&rsquo;re not able to use the DPD app, DPD is still able to offer a contact-free delivery. They will take a picture of your property and capture a proof of delivery name instead of capturing your signature. You&rsquo;re also able to use the DPD app to change the date of your delivery.</li>
						<li>Royal Mail is an unsigned service. Where Royal Mail needs to deliver a parcel, its teams will place the parcel at your door. Having knocked on the door, the delivery teams will step aside to a safe distance while the item is retrieved. If the delivery cannot take place, Royal Mail will take the parcel to the local depot for you to collect. The parcel will be held for 18 days as per normal process.</li>
						<li>To see the courier partner for your delivery, please check your dispatch confirmation email (which will also include your tracking reference). If your order is online only, it will come direct from our delivery partner, who may use different couriers. The delivery information will be in your dispatch confirmation email.</li>
